## Introduction

To gain points with these challenges you have three ways to score points per challenge.

## How to score points?

### 1 The first way (solving the challenge)

The first way to score points is to solve the challenge. You will get points for solving the challenge. Per challenge you complete you gain one single point.

### 2 The second way (fewest characters)

The second way to score points is to solve the challenge in the fewest amount of characters. The fewer characters you use to solve the challenge, the more points you will get. The points you get for the second way are calculated with the following metric:
The full code is pasted into a character counter.
For an honest scoring system, there needs to be at least one other contestant who has solved the challenge. If you are the only one who has solved the challenge, you will not get any points for the second way. Only the person with the fewest characters will get a point for that challenge.

### 3 The third way (bonus points)

The third way to score points is to solve the challenge uniquely and creatively. This is decided by a jury (the event creator). If you solve the challenge uniquely and creatively, you will get a bonus point. The bonus point is added to the points you get for the other scoring metrics.
