# Coding-Challenge-Meetup
On February 15th, the frontend guild is hosting a one-of-a-kind meetup dedicated to Coding Challenges! As we start a year without weekly challenges hosted on Slack, we've crafted a unique evening to inspire, challenge, and celebrate our coding community once more. ðŸš€

## How does the scoring go?

To gain points with these challenges you have three ways to score points per challenge.
This is explained in the [Scoring.md](Scoring.md) file.

## What are the challenges?

We have two lists of challenges. The first list is the list of JavaScript challenges. You can find it here: [JavaScript-Challenges.md](challenges/JavaScript-Challenges.md). The second list contains only CSS challenges. You can find it here: [CSS-Challenges.md](challenges/CSS-Challenges.md).

## How to submit your solution?

You can submit your solutions by cloning this repository and sending the public repo link to the organizers. Here you can find more information on how to submit your solutions: [Submissions.md](Submissions.md).

## Some rules and what is allowed?

Basically: you can use any resource you want, but you need to solve the challenge yourself. You can't copy solutions from ChatGPT, other AI's, the internet or from other people.
libraries, frameworks, and tools are allowed. But they need to be embedded in your solution file. You can't use external libraries, frameworks, and tools that are not embedded in your solution file. The file needs to be self-contained and runnable in a browser.
